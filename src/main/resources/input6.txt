In the first-person narrative, we can only see, think, and feel through Sal, further filtered by the lens of memory, and Kerouac sticks to this thoroughly and admirably.
 Sal thinks in verbose descriptive impressions and long, rambling sentences, like the way Sal and Dean and Carlo talk, and dense paragraphs often over a page long. 
The sentences attain a breathless quality, skillfully embodying the excitement and motion of the characters and events (for an example, see the 150-word sentence 
describing Dean working as a parking-lot attendant). In a more sober interpretation, the language is sometimes elegiac, suggesting Sal's nostalgia for a past that is irretrievably gone.
