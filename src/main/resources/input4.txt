Spring arrives, and everyone is getting ready to go somewhere. At the bus station, Carlo and Dean and Sal take pictures in the booth before Dean, 
proud wearing a new suit, leaves to go back to Denver; his "first fling" in New York is over. Sal gives a rhapsodic description of Dean's abilities 
as "the most fantastic parking-lot attendant in the world." Sal promises himself that he will follow Dean west soon. He likes Dean because of his 
exuberance, eagerness, uneducated intelligence, and what he sees as his Western spirit, different from Sal's other friends, "intellectuals" or criminals. 
Sal feels like Dean is a long-lost brother. Also he admits to being interested in Dean as a writer needing new experiences.
