Dean and Marylou are living in Hoboken, and Dean has gotten a job in a parking lot. They fight, Marylou sets the police after him,
 and Dean goes to where Sal lives--his aunt's house in Paterson, New Jersey. Marylou has left Dean and gone back to Denver. 
Sal and Dean talk about writing in intellectual jargon that Sal admits neither of them truly understand; 
Dean has come to Sal and his friends because he wants to be a writer and a "real intellectual." Sal likes Dean's madness. 
It is decided that Dean will stay with Sal for a while, and that they will go West together sometime.
