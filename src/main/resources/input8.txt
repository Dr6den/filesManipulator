The opening section also introduces an important characterization of Dean as a "holy con-man": the combination of veneration and truthful perception 
is a tone central to the entire novel. The idea of a trickster hero-saint appears in many mythologies, such as the Monkey King in Chinese literature. 
In On the Road, this idea is humanized and complex, applying to both Dean and the events of the novel. Sal knows that eventually, Dean may disappoint 
and desert him, but he loves him anyway and goes along for the adventure. Dean is saint and con-man at once. It's a kind of faith Sal is describing, 
making reason and rationality irrelevant. Similarly, the adventure may later prove to be a hollow sham, but for this moment, it is grand.
