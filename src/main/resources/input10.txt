Sal and Montana Slim hit the bars. Sal tries to pick up a Mexican waitress, but she puts him off kindly. 
They go to another bar and pick up two plain girls. Sal is getting more drunk and spends all but his last two dollars, 
wanting to sleep with one of the girls, but she isn't interested. Sal falls asleep in the bus station. 
He wakes alone and goes out to the highway to hitch again. He's sick and hungover at first, but feels better when he gets to Longmont, 
Colorado. After a nap on a patch of grass in front of a gas station, he looks at the Rockies and feels more and more excited, anticipating 
Denver. He is full of joy when his next ride lets him off at Larimer Street, in Denver.
