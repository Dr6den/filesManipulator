Sal describes his friends as thoroughly and truthfully as he can, and seems to also depict himself truthfully, sometimes self-deprecatingly. 
He is definitely the writer, the observer, often a little behind or at a distance--perhaps to see more clearly: when Dean and Carlo Marx meet, 
Sal falls behind them at once, watching them. He's also late in starting west, and can't hitchhike and travel as easily as he thought, 
having to take the bus all the way to Chicago. The others, he imagines, are already there, having great fun. Sal's appreciation of Dean's reckless 
impulsiveness and seeming ease is sharpened by his desire to have these qualities himself.
